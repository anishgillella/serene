# Conflict Triggers & Escalation Analysis - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This documentation outlines a phased approach to implement conflict trigger detection and escalation pattern analysis in Serene. The goal is to capture how conflicts are interconnected—where one unresolved issue becomes ammunition in the next fight.

**Example:** Partner says "You didn't do that yesterday. You didn't wash the dishes yesterday." This isn't a new conflict; it's an escalation of yesterday's unresolved issue.

## Product Vision

Enable couples to understand:
1. **Why** they keep having the same fight
2. **What** the actual issue is beneath surface complaints
3. **How** to break escalation patterns
4. **When** conflicts are likely to explode

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data Capture & Enrichment (Foundation)
- Enhanced conflict metadata
- Trigger phrase extraction
- Underlying need identification

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Pattern Detection (Analytics)
- Trigger phrase analytics
- Escalation tracking
- Pattern recognition

### Phase 3: Luna's Awareness (Intervention)
- Context-aware mediation
- Personalized insights
- Real-time pattern detection

### Phase 4: Dashboard Visualization (User Value)
- Conflict timeline visualization
- Trigger phrase analytics dashboard
- Health metrics & risk scoring

## Key Principles

1. **Data First**: Can't analyze patterns you don't capture
2. **Non-Breaking**: Each phase enhances existing data without breaking changes
3. **Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers independent value
4. **Privacy-Focused**: All analysis stays within the relationship context
5. **LLM-Driven**: Use existing GPT-4o-mini for intelligent extraction

## Success Metrics

- Couples identify 3+ unresolved issues in their history
- System predicts escalation with 70%+ accuracy
- Luna references past conflicts correctly 80%+ of the time
- Users reduce conflict recurrence by 30% after using insights
